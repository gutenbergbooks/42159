<h2>EDITH AND THE CHICKENS.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="62" height="150" alt="&quot;O" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />H, tie on my hat quick, dear mamma, please," called
Edith Gray, running up stairs as fast as her little
feet would carry her; "for grandma says I may go
with her to see the chickens."</div>

<p>Edith was four years old, and had come the day
before, for the first time in her life, to stay on a large
farm. She had never seen young chickens, except in picture-books:
so you can imagine how pleased she was at the
thought of seeing real live ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>She was soon in the farmyard, and after feeding the little
things with meal and water,&mdash;hasty-pudding she called it,&mdash;she
seemed to long so to pet them, that her kind grandmother
said, "Well, dear, hold up your apron, and I will put
some of the chickens in; but you must handle them very
gently."</p>

<p>Edith was delighted, and begged to carry them into the
house for mamma to see. Old mother-hen, who was busy
scratching for the rest of her brood, did not at first notice
what was going on. But, when she saw Edith walking off
with some of her darlings, she began to spread her wings,
and puff out her feathers, and scold in hen fashion.</p>

<p>Then the tall old rooster straightened himself up and
looked down at her, as much as to say, "What a goose you
are to make such a fuss! The little girl will bring your
chicks back all safe."</p>

<p>And so she did; and the next day, when she picked them
up and petted them again, Mrs. Hen did not say a word,
but seemed quite pleased and proud.</p>

<h2>HOW THE OLD SPARROW HELPED
THE YOUNG ONE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/drop_a.png" width="75" height="150" alt="A" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />N unfledged sparrow, not strong enough to fly far,
had fallen into the area of a city basement.</div>

<p>The poor little bird was wasting its strength in
vain attempts to get out of its prison, while its
mother looked down in alarm, and tried her best
to cheer and aid her child.</p>

<p>At last the old bird flew away. "Can it be," I thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
"that she is going to desert her little one?" No indeed!
She had only hit upon a new plan.</p>

<p>Back she soon came with a stout straw in her beak.
Perching on an iron bar which crossed the area about a foot
below the level of the street, she passed one end of the
straw to the little captive below.</p>

<p>The nestling took the offered straw in its beak and clung
to it, while the mother, holding fast to the other end, flew
up to the street. Thus, with some aid from its own wings,
the little bird was able to gain a foothold on the iron bar.</p>

<p>From this point, one more pull by the old bird helped it
to reach the pavement, where it fluttered away with its
delighted mother.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />OW real jolly it seems to be back in our own parlor
again!" said Willie Morton, making a flying leap
over an ottoman as he spoke.</div>

<p>With his elder brother he had been away at school
for a year, while his mother and sisters were travelling
abroad. This was the first evening that they were all
together again.</p>

<p>"Come, sister Annie," Willie continued, "sing 'Home,
sweet home!' Charlie can play it on the flute."</p>

<p>So Annie took her place at the piano; their mother seated
herself to listen, with little Amy on her lap; and Charlie
produced his flute. They were soon singing the old familiar
song with all their hearts, Willie's voice loudest of all.</p>

<p>When this song was ended, he proposed singing "The
star-spangled banner," "because," as he said to his sister,
"you ought to rejoice to be under the old flag again."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/illus295.jpg" width="468" height="600" alt="family around a piano" />
</div>

<p>The singing over, the excited boy roused up his little
sister, who had almost fallen asleep in her mother's lap, and
whirled her round in what he called a waltz, till his mother
said it was quite time to dance off to bed.</p>

<p>The last sound heard as he ran up stairs was, "Hurrah!
there's no place like home!"</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE SAILOR.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/illus297b.png" width="105" height="200" alt="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; HAD just finished reading the last number of "The
Nursery" to my little six-year-old boy. "Read it
all over again, mamma," he said. "Why don't the
'Nurseries' come oftener, so you could read me a
new story every minute?"</div>

<p>What a silly question, wasn't it? But I didn't tell him
it was silly. I sang the frog-song over again with a good
many croaks and kerchugs to make it lively; then we all
made ready&mdash;the two aunts, papa, my little boy, and myself&mdash;to
go out sailing in the harbor.</p>

<p>Did any of your "Nursery" readers ever take a sail in
Captain Burdette's sail-boat "Fearless" on the smooth water
at Nantucket? Well, if you did, didn't you have a jolly
time? And, if you didn't, do try it some day when the
wind blows just enough to fill the white sail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a merry party, and our little boy was so full of
play, that he dragged the boat-broom in the wake of the
boat. Then he tried to stand on the forward-deck, and hold
on by the mast. But the wind shifted a little, and the sail
turned about so suddenly, that it came near pushing him
into the water.</p>

<p>So papa ordered him into the stern, where the ladies were,
and gave him permission to take hold of the tiller, and help
steer the boat. He helped turn her toward the jetty which
the government is building to make the water deeper, so
that large ships may sail safely into the harbor.</p>

<p>Just as we made the turn, we saw another boat coming
towards us. The tide was driving it swiftly along, and it
bobbed up and down on the sparkling ripples. A little chap
was standing on the bow, drying his wet bare legs in the
sunshine. He seemed to be enjoying himself hugely, and
paid no attention to our party.</p>

<p>He had a dark mantle thrown over his white vest, and
was straight and slim like a naval cadet. By and by he
gave his tail a little shake, lifted his two wings, and took
himself off the water-soaked stick he had used for a sail-boat.
Then he went screaming with his mates high up in
the air.</p>

<p>I dare say you know by this time that I am talking about
a sea-gull,&mdash;one of those birds which fly in such numbers
about the seacoasts. My little boy wished he could fly like
a gull, but thought it wouldn't be wise to be always hungry
for a fish-dinner, as those who study their habits say sea-gulls
always are.</p>

<td align="left"><span class="smcap">Each</span> cricket was invited, 'twas after twelve at night;<br />
The fire was burning brightly, and not a puss in sight,<br />
When out popped twenty couples, all chirping loud and clear:<br />
The moon peeped in the window, as if it paused to hear.<br />
<br />
The band stood on a table,&mdash;a fiddle and a harp;<br />
The former was a trifle flat, the latter rather sharp:<br />
But, oh the jolly dancing, the capers queer and gay!<br />
Why, pigeon-wings were nothing, and double-shuffles, play.<br />
<br />
The belles reclined in corners, and chatted to the beaux,<br />
Who looked so neat and graceful, each turning out his toes;<br />
And all the daddy-crickets were happy as could be,<br />
Their little baby-crickets they dandled on their knee.<br />

A Daddy Longlegs handed a lady out to dance,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>'Twas said he was a baron,&mdash;quite modest was her glance;<br />
He kissed her hand politely, his style they all admired;<br />
He bowed to her sedately; she courtesied and retired.<br />
<br />
A dozen tiny crickets then tried a minuet,<br />
And many other dances whose names you would forget.<br />
The fiddler scraped up louder, a mouse peeped out to see;<br />
But laughed his head off nearly to mark such jollity!<br />
<br />
The supper, oh, that supper! From brimming cups of dew<br />
They sipped, and luscious goodies were spread out,&mdash;not a few.<br />
They handed round in slices a dainty Christmas cake<br />
That very much resembled a tiny snowy flake.<br />
<br />
They didn't stop till morning; they heard a rooster crow,<br />
And then the merry fiddler put away his bow;<br />
And twenty jolly couples with weary legs retire<br />
As Bridget pops in lively to make the kitchen-fire.<br />

<h2>SO TIRED!</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px;">

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />ELLY was a bright, happy little girl. Her home was
in the country; and in summer, as soon as the birds
began to sing, her eyes were wide open, and she
was ready to jump and play and sing too.</div>

<p>Then, as soon as she was nicely bathed and dressed,
and her curly hair tied with a pretty ribbon, away she would
go out of doors, to gather flowers, or feed the chickens, or
play with the kitten.</p>

<p>After breakfast she would go into the field where the
hay was making, and help with her own little rake to toss
and spread it. But at eleven o'clock her mother would call
her in, put on her cool night-dress, and lay her in her crib
for a nap, and by that time the little girl was usually tired
enough to be glad to go to sleep.</p>

<p>But one day she was having such a nice time with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
little cousins who had come to play with her, that, when her
mother called her in for her nap, she said, "Oh, please,
mamma, don't make me go to sleep to-day; I'm not a bit
sleepy. See how wide open my eyes are!"</p>

<p>Her mother laughed and said, "Well, darling, we'll try it
this once, but I'm afraid you will be tired before night."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! mamma, I shall not be tired, I know, because
I am having such a good time."</p>

<p>So she played on merrily until her dinner at one o'clock,
and, as soon as that was over, she was off again for another
frolic. By and by she came in, looking very weary, and
said, "I don't want to play out any more, mamma: I think
it's time for my supper."</p>

<p>Now it was not yet five o'clock, and her usual supper
hour was half-past six. But her mamma at once put some
nice bread and butter on the table and her mug of milk, and
left her to eat it, while she went to speak to a friend.</p>

<p>When she came back soon after, Miss Nelly had pushed
back her plate, upset her mug, laid down her apron, dropped
her head on her chubby arm, and gone fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next day when mamma called her for her nap, she
ran quickly, saying, "All ready, mamma, because I was so
tired yesterday."</p>

<h2>THE DOLL THAT FANNY FOUND.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 51px;">
<img src="images/drop_f.png" width="51" height="135" alt="F" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />ANNY went to spend her vacation with her grandma,
who lived in the country. For a whole week every
day was pleasant, and she had a lovely time.</div>

<p>She picked berries for grandma to make pies.
She drove the cows home from the pasture every
night. She rode into the fields in the hay-cart, and came
home on the big loads of hay. She fed the chickens, and
played with the kittens. But at last there came a rainy
day.</p>

<p>Fanny heard the rain pattering on the window the first
thing when she awoke in the morning. As soon as grandma
opened the door to call her, she cried out: "O grandma!
see how it rains! What shall I do to-day?"</p>

<p>"You can stay in the house with me," said grandma; "I
have not seen much of my little girl yet."</p>

<p>"Well, you must tell me what to do," said Fanny.</p>

<p>"You can go up in the garret and play. There is where
your mother and aunt Sarah used to spend a good many
rainy days," said grandma.</p>

<p>So, after breakfast, Fanny went into the attic. The attic
was a very large room, containing old spinning-wheels, chests,
boxes, and many other things&mdash;such as are always found
in attics.</p>

<p>"Now for a grand rummage!" said Fanny, and she began
to look over the boxes and chests to see what she could find.
In some of the boxes there were books and papers. In
one of them there were old dresses and bonnets. Fanny
pulled the things out of this box, one after another, and as
she reached the bottom, she cried, "Oh, what have I found!
what have I found!"</p>

<p>It was a large old-fashioned rag-baby almost as large as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
real baby a few weeks old. Its face and clothes were soiled
and faded; its cap was torn and yellow; and it had but one
shoe: but the little girl was delighted with it.</p>

<p>She had a number of handsome dolls at home; but she
had never seen one like this before.</p>

<p>"How nice and soft it is to hold!" said Fanny. "I must
go right down and show it to grandma, and ask her all
about it."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus307.jpg" width="400" height="351" alt="Fanny with the dolly" />
</div>

<p>She found grandma in the milk-room, churning cream.
"See what I have found, grandma," said Fanny, holding the
baby up before her. "Now do tell me whose baby this is."</p>

<p>"Oh," said grandma, laughing, "I made that doll for
your mother when she was a little girl. I remember how
pleased she was with it. She named it Sally."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think old Sally is splendid, and I am going to play
with her all the time I am here," said Fanny.</p>

<p>All the rest of her vacation, Sally was Fanny's pet and
plaything. She made new clothes for her, took her out to
walk and ride every day, and put her to bed every night.</p>

<p>In the picture you may see Fanny and Sally out in the
fields together.</p>

<h2>ALL TRUE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span>, a lady living not far from
Boston, has a bantam hen, who, every
spring morning, walks into the house,
and lays an egg in a rocking-chair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus308.png" width="200" height="190" alt="Chicken in window seat" />
</div>

<p>After laying the egg, Mrs. Bantam
jumps up on the window-seat and says
"Cut, cut, cut, cut-ah-cut!"</p>

<p>A turkey belonging to this same lady, who is very fond
of pets, once came off her nest with one poor little fledgeling;
a duck appeared, about the same time, with only one duckling;
and, strangely enough, a hen was roaming about with
one solitary chicken.</p>

<p>Mrs. F. thought that the three young ones might as well
make one family: so she put the young turkey and the
duckling with the hen, and Mistress Biddy took care of them
with her own chicken, just as though she were the true
mother of them all.</p>

<p>Mrs. F. used to take all three up in her lap and feed
them. When put down, the turkey and the duckling would
stretch their long necks up, looking wistfully at her, as if
coaxing her to take them up again. But the chicken did
not seem to care about being petted.</p>

<h2>A KNOWING DOG.</h2>

<img src="images/drop_e.png" width="55" height="135" alt="E" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br /><br />THEL is never tired of talking about her dog Flash.
One of his accomplishments, she tells me, is his
graceful way of setting the table.</div>

<p>When it is time for Flash to have his dinner, his
master says, "Flash, bring the table-cloth!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/illus311.jpg" width="233" height="400" alt="A black dog sitting up begging" />
</div>
<p>Off he runs to the newspaper-rack,
gets a paper, and lays it
at his master's feet. "Spread
it out!" is the next command.</p>


<p>Quickly he opens the paper to
its full extent, and places it on
the floor carefully. He waits
patiently for the bones that are
to reward his obedience. When
they have been put on the clean
"table-cloth," he begins his nice
feast. Dinner over, Flash picks
up the paper cloth, and carries
it out of the room for the cook
to burn.</p>

<p>Ethel says that Flash can tell
time; for at just such a minute
every day, the dog comes to
his master, sits up straight,
with his front paws drooping
gracefully, and asks, in
his dumb way, for something to eat. And when the time
comes for his master to go down town to business, Flash is
sure to give him a hint; for Flash is very punctual, you
see, and does not approve of delay.</p>

<p>One day Flash brought an intimate friend, a red setter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and introduced him to his master. Flash stood wagging
his tail, while the caller was politely caressed. Then the
two dogs trotted off together, and Flash's playmate had a
new name to put on his visiting list.</p>

sat there, singing joyously.</p>

There I live; but in this nut-tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oftener I may be found.</span><br />
<br />
"Long before the bright sun rises,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here to gather nuts I roam:</span><br />
They'll be needed in the winter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By my little ones at home.</span><br />
<br />
"For when shrill the north wind whistles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through these branches black and bare,</span><br />
When the nuts and leaves have vanished,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the snow fills all the air&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"Then, to pay me for my trouble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll have plenty and to spare.</span><br />
Safe at home I'll pass the winter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little for the storm I'll care.</span><br />

"That reminds me I am idle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While I'm talking here to you.</span><br />
Why, dear me! how dark it's growing!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I still have work to do."</span><br />
<br />
Throwing then a nutshell at me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Winking with his eyes so bright,</span><br />
Off he scampered through the branches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where he soon was lost to sight.</span><br />
<br />
Grandma heard about the squirrel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straightway then did grandma make</span><br />
Many little squirrels like it,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only hers were made of cake!</span><br />

1. Roly-Poly is three years old;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yes, three years old and a trifle over;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Roly-Poly is round as a ball,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As jolly as larks, and sweet as clover.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Roly-Poly has stars for eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A heavenly chin with a dimple in it;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Peaches for cheeks, the bud of a nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And a tongue that is never still a minute.</span><br />
<br />
2. Roly-Poly's a business man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He rides to market on Grandpa's cane;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He orders breakfast of peppermint drops,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then gallops his pony home again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Roly-Poly rules everything;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">His father and mother are captives wholly;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sisters must yield to such a king,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who will make all obey him, Roly-Poly.</span><br />
